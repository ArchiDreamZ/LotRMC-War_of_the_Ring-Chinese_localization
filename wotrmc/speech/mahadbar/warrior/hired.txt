I await your orders, #.
I stand with you.
My blade is yours, #.
I would follow you into the Eastern Mountains itself!
The lands of the Karavali shall burn!
For the Kings! For Mahadbar!
I cannot wait to see the Gulf-folk on their dread-ships again.
I have waited long for the day of our vengeance!
The Karavali are weak, #. They will not survive our assault!
I am ready to fight with you!
Our people are stronger, faster, and better armed than those Northwestern brutes.
The Dwarves are weak.
Let us march West, #!
Long have I wished to lay waste to the lands of Karavali, #.
I will do as you wish.
I will follow you to the freezing North and back, if I get Dwarf-blood on my blade!
