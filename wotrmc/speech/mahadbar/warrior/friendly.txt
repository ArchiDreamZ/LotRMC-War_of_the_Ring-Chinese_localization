Remember, #, the Men of Karavali are evil. We must destroy them.
Every time a Karavali falls, our ancestors celebrate!
Dwarves and their hoards, bah! They will give them to us, or we will make them!
Our armies will soon meet with our war-kin from the West. Vengeance is near, #!
You should never trust the Dwarves, #! They are greedy, and evil.
The folk of Karavali find themselves trapped, #. Mahadbar, Paraliakos, and the Gulf-folk will put them to the sword!
Our people have suffered enough at the hands of the Karavali. We shall destroy them!
Once, many lives ago, the Men of Karavali tried to raze our lands. We have not forgiven them.
Be careful when journeying into the mountains, #. They say great lizards, and fell things, lurk there.
Will you fight with us, #?
I see you share a hatred for the villainous dwarves.
Take up your sword and spear, #, and follow us to victory!
Make no mistake, #. Our people may suffer in this war with the Dwarves - but we will be victorious.
Soon comes an end to the wickedness of the Karavali.
The Karavali will burn, and the Dwarf-halls wll crumble!
We march West soon. Be sure you are ready, #.
Our battle-brethren come from the West and the South. We have them in our trap, and they shall not leave.
