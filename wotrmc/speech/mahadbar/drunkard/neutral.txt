The Karavali scum will fall to our blades...who are they again?
Just one more drop!
My stomach hurts...
It has been so long, #, and I have still not forgotten our feud! Have at you!
Have you seen somebody? I am searching for him. He is very old, you know! Oh, and he has a large hat!
Why am I here? Why are you here? Where is my house?
You know...what was I going to say?
I saw a man on a horse the other day. It wasn't very special, save that he was ten feet tall!
I will give my life to defend these lands! Where did I leave my sword?
Just one more cup for me!
Where did I put my money?
Who are you, #?
Ah, #! My son! My old friend!
Parched! I am parched! Give me drink, #, give me drink!
Where are my friends, #? Have you seen them?
What time is it, #? Early enough to start drinking.
Let us have more wine!
You know, they used to call me "The Butcher". Of what, I don't know.
I am so sad! No, I am so happy! But I am so sad! I don't know what to do, #!
#, there you are! Quickly, we must set this place on fire.
Do you know where my money pouch is?
I had given my money pouch to an elderly lady some time ago...but I can't remember where I put it!
They say there are Orcs in the west. Orcs! Have you ever heard of those?
Hi, #, do you want some money! I am a very rich man, you know. In line to become the king!
Sometimes I go swimming to cheer myself up. Swimming in liquor! Ha! Ha! 
You there! #! How about you buy us all a round?
Have I seen you? Oh, I remember you now! You are that...who are you?
#! You look like someone who can have a drink with a true Mahadbari! Cheers!
Hey! You there! Wait...you're too tall to be a dwarf!
