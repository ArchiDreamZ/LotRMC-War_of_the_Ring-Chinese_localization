My men are here, #, to serve you - and the gods above.
My men are the greatest in Mahadbar, #. They will serve you well.
I have trained my men to be as stout as stones, fierce as fire, and as fast as foxes. Now, they are yours.
I suppose I could spare you a few of my men, my friend. For the right price, of course.
Our kings are pleased with your service. You may hire my men, if you wish.
Truly, #, you are a ruthless warrior. Just so, to make the Dwarves bleed!
I have heard much of your deeds, and your strength in battle. You may command my warriors. Take back what is ours!
A fine warrior like yourself would be well suited to lead a raid against Gondor.
Our kings bid us to prepare for war. You may have my army, #.
Soon we will reclaim our lands, #.
Be ready, #. The dawn of our empire begins anew, very soon.
