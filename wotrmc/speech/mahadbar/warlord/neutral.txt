Who do you think you are, to command my men into battle? You are no one, #!
Oh, #? I have heard nothing of that name. I can only allow Men of strength and honour to command my warriors.
You truly believe that you could lead my men into battle? You must be drunk, #. Hah!
I have seen many of my brothers die on the field. But you, # - you have seen nothing of battle.
It does not matter how much coin you have, #. My men will not follow you!
My men would never follow you, #, no more than they would follow the Dwarf-Lords!
Had you spoken any more insult, #, I would cut you down where you stand. Prove yourself, and I will think otherwise. 
You are not truly one of us, #. Not yet.
You do not have what it takes to command our warriors. Begone, #.
