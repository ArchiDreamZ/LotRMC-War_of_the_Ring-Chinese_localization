Flee, you Karavali filth!
Begone, #!
You are an enemy of our people, and with the Karavali!
Run back to Karavali, #!
The Dwarves can't help you now!
Get out of these lands, #.
We do not welcome you here, fool!
Leave, or feel my wrath!
Evil men such as you have no place here!
I was in a bad mood today, thank you!
I fight for my land, and my people! You serve fools, demons and thieves!
Your Westlands will not survive the might of the East!
I will strike you down!
These lands are ours, and you are no longer welcome here!
We do not suffer evil in our lands!
